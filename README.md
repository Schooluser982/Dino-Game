# Dino-Game
This project is a Dino Game Clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a dinosaur that runs, jumps, and avoids obstacles while the ground scrolls continuously. A little bit of math is used to control the jump movement, ground animation, and score tracking, making the gameplay smooth and responsive. Cactuses appear at random intervals, adding variety and challenge to each run. The speed gradually increases over time to make the game more exciting, and collision detection ensures the game ends when the dinosaur hits an obstacle. Players can restart anytime by pressing a key.
